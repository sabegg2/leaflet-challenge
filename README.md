# leaflet-challenge
- Module 15 Challenge
- Steph Abegg

In this challenge, we were tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS earthquake data using leaflet. This challenge had two parts:

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

Part 2: Plot Tectonic Plates, Add Other Base Maps, Add Layer Controls (optional)

## Files

The files for my earthquake visualization are:

[index.html](Leaflet-Parts-1and2/index.html)

[logic.js](Leaflet-Parts-1and2/static/js/logic.js)

[style.css](Leaflet-Parts-1and2/static/css/style.css)

The index.html file is the main HTML file for the web application, providing the basic structure of the web application and including references to the logic.js and style.css files. The logic.js file contains JavaScript code that handles the core logic of a web application and specific functionality within it. The style.css file contains the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code used to style and layout the HTML elements of the web page.

## The map

The following images show what the earthquake map looks like. The second map shows a different map option and the tectonic plates layer which illustrates the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
